Unlike some other derivatives such as futures and forwards, options do have value at initiation, which means that cash changes hands right away. Selling options is referred to as writing options and it's a lot like underwriting an insurance policy.

The good news is you immediately receive a premium for the financial product you’ve just created. But there is, of course, a catch. You are obliged to compensate the option holder for any losses caused by an adverse movement in stock prices. If you buy an option, the most you can lose is the premium you paid. But if you write an option, your potential losses are unlimited. Let's see how it works.
