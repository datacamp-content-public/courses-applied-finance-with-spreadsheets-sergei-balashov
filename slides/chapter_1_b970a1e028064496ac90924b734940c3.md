Unlike some other derivatives such as futures and forwards, options do have value at initiation, which means that cash changes hands right away. Selling options is referred to as writing options and it's a lot like underwriting an insurance policy.

The good news is you immediately receive a premium for the financial product youâ€™ve just created. But there is, of course, a catch. Just like an insurer, you are obliged to compensate the option holder if the market moves against them. This means your potential losses are unlimited, while the maximum gain is the positive cash flows you received at initiation. If you buy an option, there is no obligation to exercise it. The most you can lose is the premium you paid, but your potential gains are unlimited. Let's see how it works.
