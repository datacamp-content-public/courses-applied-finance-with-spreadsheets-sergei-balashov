What makes options stand out from other derivatives such as futures , forwards and swaps is that they do have value at initiation with cash changing hands right away. Selling options is referred to as writing options and it's a lot like underwriting an insurance policy.

## Buying and writing options

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "acb0f39ac4"
```

`@part1`
### Buying

- Negative cash flow at initiation
- Maximum loss limited to premium
- Maximum gain is unlimited
- No obligation to exercise option

`@part2`
### Writing
- Positive cash flow at initiation
- Maximum loss is unlimited
- Maximum gain is limited to premium
- Obligation to pay if option is exercised

The good news is you immediately receive a premium for the financial product youâ€™ve just created. But if the market moves against the option holder, it's your problem as you have to cover their losses. This means your potential losses are unlimited, while the maximum gain is the positive cash flow you received at initiation. If you buy an option, there is no obligation to exercise it. The most you can lose is the premium you paid, but your potential gains are unlimited. Let's see how it works.

## Writing a put

`@script`
Let's say you have received $3 for writing a put option with a $70 strike on Dodgy Corp's stock, which is trading at $80 per share. This means your position in the put option is short and the buyer is long on the option. The next day Dodgy's CEO gets caught lying to shareholders and regulators. Charges and lawsuits follow and soon enough the company goes bust. But you still have to buy the worthless stock for $70 when the option you've written is exercised. To see how much money you'll gain or lose, subtract the strike price from the closing price and use the MIN function in Google spreadsheets to see if it's negative. And don't forget to add the premium you received for the option.

## Going long on a put option

`@script`
Your loss is the other party's gain. The payoff to the buyer is calculated by using the MAX function to see whether the difference between the strike price and the closing price is greater than zero and subtracting the premium.

## Shorting a call option

Writing a call can result in a bigger loss. This is because share prices are bounded below by zero, but there is no limit on how high they can go. Let's say you have just pocketed a $5 premium for selling a $60 strike call on Get Rich Fast, Inc, which is trading at $55. The next day, the company unveils a revolutionary product to the excitement of investors. The company's sales skyrocket, profits soar and shares hit $200 by the option's expiration date. How much is this going to cost the short party? Put the option parameters into the spreadsheet. Then build the formula: use the MIN function to establish whether the difference between the strike price and the closing share price is negative and add the premium received at initiation.

`@script`
Finally, let's reverse the formula to calculate the option payoffs to the long party and assume that the stock has shot up to $300 in this scenario. Subtract the strike price from the closing price and use the MAX function to establish if it's positive. Subtract the premium paid to arrive at the net cash flow. The option has made the buyer $265 per share. Not bad.

`@script`
Great! Now you can build use spreadsheets to calculate payoffs from different types of options in different scenarios. Let's cement your knowledge with some exercises.
