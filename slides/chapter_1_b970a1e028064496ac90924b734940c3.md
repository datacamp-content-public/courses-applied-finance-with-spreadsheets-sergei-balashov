Unlike some other derivatives such as futures and forwards, options do have value at initiation, which means that cash changes hands right away. Selling options is referred to as writing options and it's a lot like underwriting an insurance policy.

## Buying and writing options

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "acb0f39ac4"
```

`@part1`
### Buying

- Negative cash flow at initiation
- Maximum loss limited to premium
- Maximum gain is unlimited
- No obligation to exercise option

The good news is you immediately receive a premium for the financial product youâ€™ve just created. But there is, of course, a catch. Just like an insurer, you are obliged to compensate the option holder if the market moves against them. This means your potential losses are unlimited, while the maximum gain is the positive cash flows you received at initiation. If you buy an option, there is no obligation to exercise it. The most you can lose is the premium you paid, but your potential gains are unlimited. Let's see how it works.

## Writing a Put

`@script`
Let's say you have received $3 for writing a put option with a $70 strike on Dodgy Corp's stock, which is trading at $80 per share. This means your position in the put option is short. The next day Dodgy's CEO gets caught lying to shareholders and regulators. Soon enough the company loses all its customers, gets hit with numerous lawsuits and goes bust. If no cash flows are expected from the failed business, its stock becomes worthless, but you still have to buy it for $70 when the option you've written is exercised. To see how much money you'll gain or lose, subtract the strike price from the closing price and use the MIN function to see if it's negative. And, finally, add the premium you received for the option.

## Going Long on a Put Option

`@script`
To work out how much you would have made had you bought the option, you need to slightly change the formula. Now you need to use the MAX function to see whether the difference between the strike price and the closing price is greater than zero. If it is, subtract the premium you paid for the option to get the final payoff. Remember if you're long on a put option, you profit is the share price falls.
