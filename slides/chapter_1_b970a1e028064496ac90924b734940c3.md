Unlike some other derivatives such as futures and forwards, options do have value at initiation, which means that cash changes hands right away. Selling options is referred to as writing options and it's a lot like underwriting an insurance policy.

The good news is you immediately receive a premium for the financial product you’ve just created. But there is, of course, a catch. Just like an insurer, you are obliged to compensate the option holder if the market moves against them. This means your potential losses are unlimited, while the maximum gain is the positive cash flows you received at initiation. If you buy an option, there is no obligation to exercise it. The most you can lose is the premium you paid, but your potential gains are unlimited. Let's see how it works.

Let's say you have received $3 for writing a put option with a $70 strike on Dodgy Corp's stock, which is trading at $80 per share. This means your position in the put option is short. The next day Dodgy's CEO gets caught lying to shareholders and regulators. Soon enough the company loses all its customers, gets hit with numerous lawsuits and goes bust. If no cash flows are expected from the failed business, its stock becomes worthless, but you still have to buy it for $70 when the option you've written is exercised. To see how much money you'll lose, use the MIN function to calculate the payoff to the option holder that you will have to cover and subtract the premium you received at initiation.
